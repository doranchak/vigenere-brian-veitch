# vigenere-brian-veitch
Web-based Vigenere cryptanalysis tools created by [Brian Veitch](http://www.brianveitch.com).

His site went down and someone on the `KRYPTOS.groups.io` group mentioned the Vigenere tools.  Wayback Machine [has a snapshot of the functioning pages](https://web.archive.org/web/20200928224739/http://www.brianveitch.com/maze-runner/) so I imported them into GitHub for posterity.

I also deployed the tools to my site here:

* [Vigenere Frequency Analysis](http://zodiackillerciphers.com/vigenere-brian-veitch/frequency-analysis/)
* [Vigenere Encode/Decode](http://zodiackillerciphers.com/vigenere-brian-veitch/encode-decode/)
